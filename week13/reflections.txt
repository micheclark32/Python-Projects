Please take a few minutes to reflect on your experience in CSE 111 and
think about the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned
along the way.


Now, please respond thoroughly (1 - 2 paragraphs for each question) to
the following questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

- Functions provied a great power of being able to not only just do something specific to your program
but to also be able to called and added to other parts of your program. I think it allows you to think
outside the box and see that your function can have properties, outputs and so much more. 


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

- Test functions are great for me personally because I think it allows me to kind of think outside the box of
what i really want my program to do. If i am able to specifically think about what I want my function to output or produce
then hopefully I can display that. But it also allows to see whats going on in those specific details as well.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

- For me, I just have to go through each program or each variable and walk through my thinking process on how i created this.
That way I can kind of ask myself why I did it this way. Maybe even ask myself if ther is a different way
to approach this. Write down my thoughts and then move on from there. I hope I can improve my research ability and really look 
more into the details of a program. I feel like a lot of times, I missed a lot of easy mistakes. So i want to improve that way.
