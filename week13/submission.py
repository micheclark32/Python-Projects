# Submission Comments #

# a.  I spent about 7 -8 hours in order to complete this project.

# b. This last week i was mainly finishing up my main program, but also spent most of
# the time on test functions. I cant seem to get them to pass for my functions.
# But this is my documentation I read and videos I watched as well to research.

# c. This week was a little difficult for me. The test functions i cant seem to figure
# out but i did submit what i attempted. I was trying to get my two functions password_props()
# and generate() to have test functions. I wanted to test generate as to count the number of
# of characters. Which it would pass always as long as everything was equal or greater
# than 8. Which is the minimum of characters for the user to chose on the generator.

# My other test funciton would of been to count the characters of letters in the password, which
# just has to be greater than or equal to 1. But i may have it wrong as to how to grab that info from my program.

# But i do have 2 functions in my main program. I was trying to get a third one which would be the main
# but for some reason, it would break after i but those labels and variables inside the main.
# I even make sure the parameters were correct. But maybe a part was not. But my program does work as is.
# I just only have 2 functions and the bottom half does not have a function and just
# makes the GUI with its labels. But it does make me a password with the correct amount of
# characters.

# My functions do perform one task each I believe and then the last half does as well.

# I did use random, string, and tkinter modules in my program. And i believe it is a real world task.

# I know on the rubric it says GUI's are hard to perform test functions. But
# I still did attempt to find some.
